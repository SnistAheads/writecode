Need to write an Algorithm/Code for the following problem. Its a basic probelm which can help you to build confidence.

{% highlight c %}
1000
0101
{% endhighlight %}

need to generate parity bits continuously: initially row-size and then column-size based on the given option of odd parity or even parity.

- ODD PARITY

{% highlight c %}
10000
01011
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
10000
01011
00100
{% endhighlight %}

and so on.. for the given number of rows and columns

similarly, for even parity too.

- EVEN PARITY

{% highlight c %}
10001
01010
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
10001
01010
11011
{% endhighlight %}

and so on..


you can discuss in the comment section below.!
